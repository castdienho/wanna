You need to copy the ROM file to the microSD card of your flashcart, and insert it into your 3DS. Then, you can launch the game from the flashcart menu. If you downloaded a CIA file, you need to have a hacked 3DS with custom firmware, such as Luma3DS or ReiNX. You need to copy the CIA file to the SD card of your 3DS, and use a CIA installer, such as FBI or BigBlueMenu, to install it on your 3DS. Then, you can launch the game from the home menu.
4. Fourth, you need to enjoy the game! You can play solo or multiplayer modes, and experience the thrilling card battles of Cardfight!! Vanguard: Ride to Victory!! on your Nintendo 3DS.
