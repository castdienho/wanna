Now that you have installed and activated AutoCAD 2017, you may want to explore some of the new features and enhancements that it offers. Here are some of the highlights:

- PDF Import: You can now import geometry, TrueType text, and raster images from a PDF file or underlay into your current drawing as AutoCAD objects. This makes it easier to reuse and edit PDF content without leaving AutoCAD. To import a PDF file, go to the Insert tab and click on PDF Import. You can choose to import the entire PDF or specify a page range or a polygonal area. You can also adjust the scale, rotation, and insertion point of the imported objects. To import a PDF underlay, go to the Insert tab and click on Attach. You can then select a PDF file and specify the attachment options. You can use the PDFCLIP command to crop the underlay to a specified boundary.
- Design View Sharing: You can now share your design views with stakeholders online without sending your drawing files. This allows you to get feedback and comments on your designs without compromising your data security. To share a design view, go to the A360 tab and click on Share Design View. You can then choose which views and layouts you want to share and specify the expiration date of the link. You can also add a password for extra protection. Once you share the design view, you can copy the link or send it via email. The recipients can view and comment on your design view using a web browser without installing any software.
- Center Marks and Center Lines: You can now create and edit center marks and center lines more quickly and intuitively. When you move associated objects, the center marks and center lines update accordingly. To create a center mark, go to the Annotate tab and click on Center Mark. You can then select a circle or an arc to place the center mark. To create a center line, go to the Annotate tab and click on Centerline. You can then select two lines or two circles to place the center line. You can use the CENTERMARK and CENTERLINE commands to modify the properties of the center marks and center lines.
